# World Passport Color

![world passport color](./src/04_fill-map/fullMap.png)

The map shows every country in the color of its real passport.

The map has been colored by a python script averaging the real image of every
country's passport.

**NOTE**: with a few modifications the code can be used to create python scripts 
coloring the world map by simply associating a color with the country code.
